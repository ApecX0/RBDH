		<h1 align="center">ABOUT US</h1>
		<p>&emsp;By having responsibilities and sympathy towards orphans, a group of activists and Selangor State Government's Senior Officer had successfully established ‚ÄúPertubuhan Pendidikan Anak-Anak Yatim Selangor‚Äù following the registration number ARS/Sel/50/66 on 16 August 1966. With the approval of this registration, the authorities worked hard to achieve the purpose of the organisation. As a recognition to Y.Bhg Allahyarham Dato‚Äô Haji Harun Idris and his wife Y.Bhg Datin Salmah Suleiman for their contribution, therefore the state government bestow upon them a piece of 4.8 acres land at Hulu Kelang district (HS.231). To ensure the project will be successfully implemented, therefore Y.Bhg Allahyarham Dato‚Äô Haji Harun Idris was chosen to be the chairman of this organisation.</p>
		<p>&emsp;As a reward of their hardworks, a few events such as the annual dinner, Premiere Show and also an appeal for the members, this organisation successfully built Rumah Bakti with the cost of RM158, 107.81. DYMM Almarhum Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Alhaj ibni Almarhum Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah Sultan Selangor has agreed to be a patron of RBHK. In the early stages, the adoption of the orphanage started in the year of 1976 with as many as 26 people which consists of 13 males and 13 females with the age between 6 to 12 years old. RBHK was inaugurated by DYMM Sultan Selangor on March 5th, 1977. Each year goes by, the number of orphans has increased and until 2017, Rumah Bakti has 66 orphans with the age between 7 to 17 years old.</p>

        <p>&emsp;On March 2, 1982, two new 2-story dormitory blocks were built. The two dormitory blocks are worth RM600,000.00 and were donated by Selangor's State Government and also public donations. A surau was also built in 1984. In 2009 a new surau was built to replace the old one. This new surau was conntributed by Y.Bhg Datin Salmah  Sulaiman, the wife of Allahyarham Dato‚Äô Haji Harun Idris. RBHK built a new library in the year 1989. Since RBHK has got a new surau, the old surau that was built in 1984 was renovated into a new Resource Center. The Resource Center is divided into two parts, the library and the computer room.</p>
        <p>&emsp;In memory of service of Y.Bhg Allahyarham Dato‚Äô Haji Harun Idris, the members of "Pertubuhan Pendidikan Anak-Anak Yatim Selangor" has agreed to change the name of Rumah Bakti Hulu Kelang (RBHK) to Rumah Bakti Dato' Harun (RBDH) along with the change of the logo of Rumah Bakti and the amendment was approved by the Registrar of Societies on 29 July 2011.</p>
